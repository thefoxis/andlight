# &amp;light

&amp;light features two themes (light and dark) for [highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js). Both of them were customized for [andyet](https://github.com/andyet) branding and usage. 

Feel free to modify and base on.

## Usage

For in-app usage with Stylus and *style* framework grab the source files and add to the global imports file. Otherwise use CSS files.

Don't forget about general styling for the `code` element (if not using *style*):

```css
code {
  font-family: Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, monospace;
  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}
```
